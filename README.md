# Focus Bear Web Prototype

Built in Next.js, this is a prototype of a productivity application, with barebones functionality, used to help students focus better.
This prototype was built in a week to test the idea of a productivity application before moving on to the mobile development phase, where the features are more built out in depth.

## Expansion

Moving on from the prototype, there are several features that will be implemented:

- _User login_: Allow for account creation to keep track of individual users' information, currency and sessions
- _Dynamic Shop Item Placement_: Creating an app to cater to so many devices in our age is definitely not easy, so being able to support most devices would be great for usability.
- _More Items + Pets_: Having more items and pets that would be randomized rewards, keeping track of which items have been collected would allow for collecting items to be more fun
- _User Analytics_: Analyze individuals' focus patterns and encourage more/less time focusing will create a more personalized experience for the users
